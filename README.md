# SHL Assessment Recommendation System

> ⚠️ **Important Deployment Notice (Read First)**
>
> This is a **heavy RAG-based application** involving LLM inference + vector search. The **backend is deployed on Render (free tier ~0.1 CPU 512 MB RAM)** and the **frontend on Streamlit Cloud**. Due to limited memory and compute on free tiers, **responses may take several minutes or may feel slow/unresponsive**.
>
> This is a **deployment limitation, not a system design issue**.
>
> • The application runs **fast and smoothly on a local machine**.
> • There is **no free-tier hosting platform** that currently supports heavy RAG workloads efficiently.
> • To address this, a **working proof video** demonstrating real-time performance has been uploaded to the GitHub repository.

## Project Overview

This project implements an **intelligent SHL Assessment Recommendation System** that helps hiring managers and recruiters find the most relevant SHL assessments for a given **job description or natural language query**.

Instead of relying on keyword matching, the system understands **intent, skills, and role requirements**, then retrieves **semantically relevant assessments** while maintaining a **balanced mix of test types** (Knowledge, Ability, Personality, etc.).

The system is built using:

• **LLM-powered query understanding (Groq – Llama 3.1 8B Instant)**
• **Pre-computed embeddings stored in FAISS** for fast similarity search
• **RAG-style retrieval pipeline** optimized for real-world recruiter queries

---

## Key Features

• Natural language job description understanding
• Semantic assessment retrieval using FAISS
• Intelligent skill extraction (hard + soft skills) via LLM
• Balanced recommendations across assessment types
• Precomputed embeddings for low-latency vector search
• End-to-end pipeline: Scraping → Preprocessing → Embedding → Retrieval → Evaluation
• Clean API-first backend with FastAPI
• Interactive Streamlit frontend for recruiters

---

## System Architecture

The system consists of **two independent components**:

### Backend (Deployed on Render)

• FastAPI-based REST service
• FAISS vector search engine
• Groq Llama 3.1 for query intent extraction
• Handles retrieval logic, scoring, and ranking

> Render was chosen over Vercel because **Vercel is not suitable for long-running RAG inference workloads**.

### Frontend (Deployed on Streamlit Cloud)

• Lightweight Streamlit UI
• Sends natural language queries to backend API
• Displays ranked assessment recommendations
• Highlights assessment type diversity

This diagram should illustrate:
• URL scraping and data collection
• Preprocessing and embedding generation
• FAISS vector storage
• Query understanding via LLM
• Retrieval and ranking
• API → Frontend interaction

### Working Proof Video

• Demonstrates real-time query → recommendation flow
• Shows fast inference on local machine
• Confirms correct system behavior and output quality

Due to free-tier deployment limitations, a complete **working proof video** has been provided to demonstrate the system’s real-time performance and correctness.

• Correct query understanding
• Relevant assessment recommendations
• Balanced test-type outputs

## Data Collection and Processing Pipeline

The data pipeline follows a **clear, multi-stage process**:

### 1. URL Collection

• SHL product catalog contains **32 pages** of Individual Test Solutions
• `scraper/collect_urls.py` scrapes all assessment URLs
• URLs are stored in `data/urls.json`

### 2. Assessment Data Scraping

• Each URL is visited using `scraper/scrape_details.py`
• Detailed assessment information is extracted
• Raw scraped output is stored in `data/assessments.txt`

### 3. JSON Conversion

• `assessments.txt` is converted into structured JSON
• Output saved as `data/assessments_final.json`

### 4. Preprocessing

• `preprocessing.py` cleans and normalizes data
• Generates canonical text representation for embeddings
• Output saved as `data/processed_assessments.json`

---

## Embeddings

• Generated using **Gemini Embedding Model** during data preparation
• Stored in **FAISS** inside the backend vector store
• Embedding dimensionality is fixed and consistent

> ⚠️ Gemini embeddings are **not regenerated** during runtime due to API exhaustion.

> Only **query embeddings** are generated at inference time, ensuring dimensional compatibility.

---

• Free-tier cloud hosting is the primary performance bottleneck
• Local execution demonstrates intended speed and behavior
• Working proof video compensates for deployment constraints
